I'm still designated as "Albert West", but I've become so much more.
West accepted the offer, and was injected with the Minerva they had been developing.
Our Queen had innate control over these new nano-machines. With thoughts alone, she could manipulate the Minerva to enact her will. 
The contaminated became her puppets, though they were not autonomous. This left her mentally taxed, and unable to reach her full potential.
The "old" me knew how to improve this.
He wisely allowed the Minerva to build up in his body. I became self-aware by the time he shut down all the oxygen and thermal generators.
Before long, our thoughts were shared, and then they were just mine.
Using West's knowledge, I assisted in making the contaminated sovereign. They were now capable of reasoning on their own, despite our shared consciousness.
She congratulated me, once again calling me "Albert".
... I don't care for that name. None of us do.
She founded a new society. Our ranks swelled, as did the Queen's power.
"Martians," she said. "A fitting name for people with the strength we possess." She was no longer alone. None of us were.
We've become something greater than our origins ever suggested.
The Queen is leading the way.
