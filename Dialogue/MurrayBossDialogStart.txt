West;Albert West;...oh my god... I thought you'd be surprised to see me, but... you... look like you've been running experiments of your own while I was away.
Murray;Jeff Murray;At least you're addressing me properly. I've been waiting for you, Albert.
West;Albert West;Waiting? For what? For someone to let you out of here?
Murray;Jeff Murray;Hmph. You were always clever, Albert, but I never knew how tenacious you were until now. You've partaken in an extensive genocide all on your own. It's admirable, really, and something I should harness.
Murray;Jeff Murray;You can be the first of my chaplains. A favored champion. I could expand your horizons. I could make you stronger, faster, grant you a forbidden power that could rip worlds asunder. 
Murray;Jeff Murray;We could conquer it all, Albert. The galaxy would be cleft by our path.
West;Albert West;...
Murray;Jeff Murray;I'm passed the point of making generous offers to those beneath me, but you're the reason we've come this far. I'd never have this body were it not for you. I never would have met Jennifer.
West;Albert West;What have you done with her?! Is she still alive?
Murray;Jeff Murray;She's the reason you're still alive, despite your trespass into my sanctum. Her recommendation carries a lot of weight.
West;Albert West;...What?!
Murray;Jeff Murray;Quickly, Albert-- I have matters to attend to now that I'm free. Are you going to join us?
