I’m still designated as “Albert West”, but I’ve become so much more.

After he had joined Jennifer, she injected him with the Minerva they had been perfecting while West was locked away. She had innate control over these new nano-machines. With thoughts alone, she could manipulate Minerva to enact her will. 

The contaminated became her puppets, though they were not autonomous. This left her mentally taxed, and unable to reach her full potential.

The “old” me knew how to help improve this.

He wisely allowed the Minerva to build up in his body. I became self-aware by the time he shut down all the oxygen and thermal generators.

Before long, our thoughts were shared, and then they were just mine.

Using Wests's knowledge, I assisted in making the contaminated sovereign. They were now capable of reasoning on their own, even though we shared consciousness. She congratulated me, once again calling me “Albert”, as if out of habit.

... I don’t care for that name. None of us do.

She founded a new society as our ranks swelled, each new member a catalyst for Jennifer's growing abilities. "Martians," she said. "A fitting name for people with the strength we possess." She was no longer alone. None of us were.

We’ve become something greater than our origins ever suggested. Jennifer is leading the way.
