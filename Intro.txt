Fourth planet in the Solar System: Mars.
Mankind's first permanent colony on Mars: MPO.
MPO is the new hope for thousands of people seeking a fresh start.
I didn't get one, though. For one year, 3 months, and 16 days, I have lived in a MPO PD prison cell. Cellblock 805, cell six.
My name is... well, was "Doctor" Albert West. It's just "West" now, at least to the guards.
An accident in my lab granted me a new title: "murderer". I lost everything and got thrown into this cell.
That's all in the past.
I've got worse problems now.
My rations have run out. The guards have disappeared. Emergency power is still on, but there's no telling for how long.
I've been stuck in here for a week or so. I've been replaying it in my head, over and over, trying to piece together what happened.
The guards had been acting suspiciously for a few days. One day, my cell never opened for breakfast.
After several hours of silence, my tray slot opened up. It must have been well past lunch: I was starving.
It was the guard. Henk.
His eyes were... strange... like his irises were bleeding. I could tell something horrible was going on, despite the silence.
"There will be a prisoner transfer today. Be ready at 17:00 hours, and take this. Heh. It'll be your only meal today."
He closed the tray slot. I could hear his steps fade as he got further away.
Suddenly, I heard noises.
Batons whistling through the air, loud thuds, people screaming. What was going on?
The room flooded with red light. A siren went off, an administrator speaking over it.
"Attention all prisoners: the transfer will begin. Cells will be opened one at a time. Follow the guards and obey their instructions."
"Prisoners that fail to comply will be executed on the spot!"
"We're starting with Section 805."
I heard the unmistakable rumble of cell doors opening through the walls.
"Cell one."
"Cell two."
"Cell three."
"Cell four."
"Cell five."
Last on the block was my cell, and I was ready to get out of here.
"Cell si--"
Darkness. Silence.
The door stopped moving. All the footsteps and shuffling moved further and further away.
I peeked into the hall through the crack, but it was empty. The guards never returned for me.
Emergency power finally kicked in. The air circulation fan started spinning again, but the door didn't budge! I was stuck!
In the past week, I've tried yelling, clanking my can, pounding on the door... no one's coming.
The only thing I can think of is the air duct. The fan's barely spinning... maybe it's safe to pass through by now.
I don't have a choice. I can't hold on for much longer.
I have to survive... if only to see her one more time.
