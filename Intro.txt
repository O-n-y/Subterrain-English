Fourth planet in the Solar system: Mars.
Mankind's first permanent colony on Mars: MPO
MPO is a new hope for 10,000 people seeking a fresh start
And in this place, for one year, 3 months, and 16 days I have lived in this MPOPD prison cell.  Sector B05 cell number 6.
My name is Albert West... They once they called me "Dr.West." I came to Mars on the promise of being able to freely conduct my research...
Ultimately it drove me to murder. I lost everything; I was locked up here.
But to hell with the past...
I'll wait for my death in this place.
My rations have run out and soon the power will shut down. Then maybe life support as well.  And then I die.
It was a week ago. I could feel that something was wrong...
Lunch time came and went; but there was no call to the dining hall.
I was getting hungry but then my chow slot opened.
It was the guard, Henk.
His eyes were... strange... I just knew something was going down...
"There will be a transfer today. Be ready at 0500 hours and take this. It'll be your only meal today, hehe..."
I didn't expect that to be my LAST meal, I've gone without food for some time now.
After he went away there were loud noises outside.
Sounds of beating batons, running; a struggle...  I could hear the sounds of other restless prisoners.
Then there was a siren.
"Attention all prisoners. Doors will be opened one cell at the time. Follow the guards and obey their instructions."
"Prisoners that fail to comply will be executed on the spot!”
Executed?  Jesus...
I heard noises from other cells, doors opening one by one.
Cell number 1.
Cell number 2.
Cell number 3.
Cell number 4.
Cell number 5.
Last was my cell, and I was ready to get out of here.
And then all of sudden:
Blackness...
Just a tiny gap in the door...
And then there was silence... All the noises seemed to be carried away from me.
After while, emergency power kicked in. Red lights and some power to the air circulation fans... but that was it. The door wouldn't budge!
And that was a week ago.  I tried everything to get out...
My only chance seems like the air duct.  The fan seems to be slowing down but it hasn't stopped yet. 
I'm reaching my limit, I can't hold on for long...
I feel so sleepy... I can't sleep... I won't sleep...
