After a short cruise, I made it to Mars Orbital Station. As I approached, a hail request lit up on the screen. I accepted the transmission - it wasn't like I could go anywhere else.
A young man in a uniform appeared on the screen. Was he security? A soldier, maybe? I couldn't tell for sure.
He asked for my name, and I hesitated... I am a murder, after all.
I think he put it together on his own, though. His eyes narrowed, and his look became stern, like he was judging my sentence.
Before I could even say a word, he cut the transmission. An ion cannon lined up with my shuttle, firing two blasts toward me.
The first missed, but the second hit the shuttle square on the port side engine. The fuel line caught fire, the tank exploding shortly after.
The explosion ripped the ship in half. A flood of red warning lights swept over the consoles. 
I barely made it to the escape pod. I didn't even have time to eject; the force of the explosion propelled me away from the debris.
...Christ! I almost made it!!         ...I almost made it...
Now, I'm aimlessly floating through space... adrift... forgotten...
