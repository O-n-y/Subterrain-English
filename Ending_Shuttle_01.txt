After a short ride we were at the Mars Orbital Station.  As I approached, I spoke to someone on the comm.
Could have been an officer, some kind of soldier... I couldn't tell for sure.
He asked for my name and I hesitated... I am a murderer after all.
But a few seconds later he seemed to have recognized my face.
Before I could explain myself, they cut off communications and fired at my shuttle with a few blasts from the ion cannon.
The first missed, but the second hit square on the port side engine.
A flood of red warning lights swept over the console as the fuel supply lit up.
I barely made it to the escape pod.  Ejecting wasn't even necessary as the force from the explosion propelled me away.
I almost made it...  Christ, I almost made it...
And now I slip out into space...  Adrift and forgotten...
