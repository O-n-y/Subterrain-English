After a short cruise, I made it to Mars Orbital Station. As I approached, a hail request lit up on the screen.
A young man in a uniform appeared on the screen. Was he Mars security? A soldier from Earth, maybe?
He asked for my name, and I hesitated... I am a murderer, after all.
His eyes narrowed, and his look became stern, like he was judging my sentence.
Before I could even say a word, he cut the transmission. An ion cannon lined up with my shuttle, firing two blasts toward me.
The first missed, but the second hit the shuttle square on the port side engine.
The explosion ripped the ship in half. A flood of red warning lights swept over the consoles. 
I barely made it to the escape pod. I didn't even have time to eject; the force of the explosion propelled me away from the debris.
...Christ! I almost made it!!                 ...I almost made it...
Now, I'm aimlessly floating through space... adrift... forgotten...
