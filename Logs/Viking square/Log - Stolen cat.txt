[ccccff][i]Here's the list, man. I just picked up:

Four trees, six tomatoes, two-thousand little meals, and... uh... an eagle? 

...I can't do this, man! These code words are stupid! Just trash this thing after you read it.

The [ffff00]cats[-] we stole from old crone [ffff00]Baxter[-] are wriggly little shits. One of them is at the safe house in [ffff00]Gemini[-]. I sold the other cat off to Ortega for a load of cash and some extra goodies on the side. I just did the hand off with one of his goons in the usual spot a few minutes ago. Come by for your cut!

...And don't forget to delete or destroy this note, you idiot! Someone's going to find it next time![/i][-]
