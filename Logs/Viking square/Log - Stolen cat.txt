[ccccff][i]Inventory:  5 trees, 6 tomatoes, and 200 little meals. Also a um... a little... uh, eagle..?  

Forget this code-talk bro, the [ffff00]cat[-] we stole from old crone [ffff00]Baxter.[-]

It's at the safe house in [ffff00]Gemini[-].

I sold the other cat off to Boss Ortega for a small mint.  He's got plans to ransom it or something lol.[/i][-]


I'm really disappointed with the criminal underworld...
