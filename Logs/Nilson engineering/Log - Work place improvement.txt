[ccccff][i]Hello, my beloved employees!

I've been making improvements to the workplace! I just got all these decorative plants from the hotel. Aren't they beautiful?! They smell a little bad, but I think they just need to air out.

I read an ebook over the weekend. It said that plants in the workplace can reduce employee stress by up to 20%! Soon, you all will be 20% less stressed! You're welcome!

It also recommends a daily cardiovascular exercise routine to prevent depression, so starting Monday, we'll be doing a mandatory workout every morning! Your mental health is my number one concern!

Also, I'm taking out the vending machines and halting the complimentary beverage program. Snack foods and sodas are going to hurt your bodies! It's difficult to work when your body is in poor shape! I care about your health!

With these workplace improvements, employees should easily be able to work an additional 15 hours each week. More hours for my beloved employees! Am I a great boss or what!?

Oh, and I need two volunteers to give up their weekend to carry plants over from the [ffff00]Carson Hotel[-]. Unfortunately, it's against regulations to compensate volunteer work, though! I hope you understand! If volunteers don't come forward, I'll be forced to dock everyone's pay so I can hire movers! Sorry about that!

I also need one of you to bring back the [ffff00]data chip[-], so come by the penthouse before you move the plants. Don't bother me after that, though! I don't like to stress out for no reason!

        Thanks!
