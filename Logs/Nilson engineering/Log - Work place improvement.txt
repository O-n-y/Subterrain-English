[ccccff][i]I got these decorative plants from the hotel.  

Aren't they beautiful!

I read a book over the weekend that says plants in the workplace can reduce employee stress by up to 20%.

The book also recommends a daily cardio-vascular exercise routine to prevent employee depression and suicides, so starting Monday we'll be doing a mandatory workout every morning.

Also, I'm taking out the junk-food machines and complimentary beverages.  With these workplace improvements, employees should easily be able to work an additional 15 hours each week.

Am I a great boss or what!?  Oh, and I need two volunteers to give up their weekend to carry plants over from the [ffff00]Carson hotel.[-]

You can find me at the penthouse suite if you need to borrow the [ffff00]data chip.[-]

But don't bother me unless it's important.  I don't like to stress out. Thanks![/i][-]
