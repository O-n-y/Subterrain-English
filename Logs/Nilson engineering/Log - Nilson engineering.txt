Nilson engineering was one of the very first facilities built here on Mars.  It's even older than Central Control.

Almost everything that exists in the colony is created in here.

Creating the colony using the advanced [ffff00]3D printing[-] technology was the only way to reduce the cost and solve the logistics problem of getting materials from Earth to mars.

Later, more advanced subjects were being created here that are only possible on Mars specific conditions.

It was important that as much material as possible was recycled, the engineering bay has facilities to [ffff00]recycle[-] and [ffff00]refine[-] most of the things you can find or grow on Mars.

This super-efficient cycle of production was later embraced back on Earth but rare materials that are only found on Mars caused a massive and continuing dispute between Mars MPO and Earth.

Today, engineering relies on the blueprint data sent from Herbert research so it can't function on its own.

The engineers worked closely with the mining facility so maybe I can find the [ffff00]key card to the mine[-] if I look around.
