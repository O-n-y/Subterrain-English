Nilson Engineering was one of the very first facilities built here on Mars. It's older than any other facility or district on Mars, including Central Control.

Almost everything on Mars is manufactured here now, including pharmaceuticals and clothing. 

[ffff00]3D printing[-] technology was the only feasible way to found a colony on Mars. The logistics issues alone would have halted MPO's development, as replacement parts would have to be shipped out from Earth.

Material shortages were also a problem on Mars back then, so the engineering bay has facilities to [ffff00]recycle[-] and [ffff00]refine[-] just about anything. This will definitely come in handy now that the colony's fallen apart.

These days, Nilson Engineering relies on the blueprint database at [ffff00]Herbert Research[-] in order to print out objects. Thankfully, Nilson's systems will cache blueprint data, so I won't lose access to blueprints if Herbert loses power.

I know the guys at Nilson had a close relationship with the Bigelow Mining Company, so maybe I can find a [ffff00]key card[-] to the mine if I dig around.
