After making a fortune on the lucrative Lunar bases, Nilson Engineering partnered with Jeff Murray to make parts for the fledgling MPO. They set up shop immediately, even before Central Control was established. Assigned to head the MPO division of Nilson was Sang Jun Bae, a retired dentist and partial heir to the Nilson fortune.

Sang Jun Bae worked very closely with the Bigelow Mining Company, a relationship that was established in the early days of MPO. Bigelow's excavator burned through parts on a daily basis, and Bae was happy to be the only supplier on the planet.

As MPO expanded, Nilson Engineering did as well. Its capabilities are now able to accommodate all of the colony's needs, including manufacturing weapons for Mars Security or shuttle parts for Murray Space Center. There was a constant problem in keeping up with demand with this expansion, though, and Bae became obsessed with improving workplace efficiency.

A lot of Nilson's employees didn't care for Bae's methods.
