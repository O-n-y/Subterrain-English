After making a fortune on the more lucrative Lunar bases, Nilson Engineering partnered with Jeff Murray to build parts for the emerging mars facility.

Working closely with the Biggelow mine company, they serve as a just-in-time manufacturing solution for drill bits, fittings, pipes, electronics, and anything else the mines need.

As the Mars base has expanded, Nilson Engineering also expanded. Its capabilities are now able to accommodate all of the colony's needs, including special parts for the casino and hotel.

The facility is run by Sang Jun Bae, Retired dentist and heir to the Nilson fortune.
