[ccccff][i]Hahaha... look at that, you've come so far. I'm sure someone would be proud.

You've probably raided an armory or something by now if you've made it this far. Maybe that'll be enough to take on Murray. He's still waiting in there. There's something you should know, though.

He's not exactly human anymore.

You probably get the picture with our version of Minerva by now: it would break down flesh and grow something else in its place. Something... inhuman. The subjects we administered Minerva to ended up reanimating once we tweaked the nanomachines enough. The robots would leave just enough of the brain stem alone to allow for primal instincts. These creatures were not sentient, and they were more like beasts than humans. Murray kept mumbling his own term, though: Martian.

This new form of life is perfectly suited for Mars, having no need for respiration and requiring minimal caloric energy to function. That's just the beginning, though. From what little I actually understood from our test sample date, the flesh comes back stronger. More robust. I'd tell you more, but I'm not sure what Murray's been up to in there, and I'd rather you finish things so I can die with a good mark to my name.

Someone's gotta do it, so it may as well be you since I'm out of the running. I spent my whole life looking out for myself, "numero uno", back in the day. I guess I have regrets, and maybe things would be different if I could tell myself that my lust for wealth and power would get me killed, alone, in some cold corner of Mars. I didn't even get to say goodbye to the people I left behind on Earth. It's pathetic, getting sad at my own funeral, a stranger as the only living guest in attendance. The only eulogy I want from you, though, is Murray's screams.

The door's open. Murry's without an army. If you're a better man than I, and odds are you are, just walk through that door. If you don't, he can just undo everything you've done so far. 

Finish this.[-][-]
