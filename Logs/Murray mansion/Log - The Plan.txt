After I pulled the switch, I noticed another note on the ground near the side of the console. It must have fallen.

[ccccff][ffffc0]April 19th:[-]
There's no way I'm making it out of here. 

I made up for my mistakes. Murray and that freak are stuck until [ffff00]all the contaminated are cleared out of MPO[-]. There's only an out-of-service shuttle left, and it only seems like a handful of people are still alive. I think it's safe to say Minerva's staying here. I can die with a little less guilt knowing that Murray and that woman are stuck here, at least for the time being.

I hope someone finds this mess and figures out how to fix our royal screw up. I mean, I sure as hell would be curious to know why MPO vanished overnight. This probably means you, buddy.

After you [ffff00]pull that switch[-], take the [ffff00]blueprint[-] that deposits in the [ffff00]mainframe container[-] on opposite side of the mainframe. Don't lose it. Follow the plan.[-]

The last bit is separated from the rest of the text, but undated:

[ccccff]left notes on terminal by gate
