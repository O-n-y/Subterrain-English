[ccccff][i]Whoever you are, well, you're the only hope anyone has. Who am I? I'm Murdoch Rascowicz. I'm the man who never wanted to go to Mars, who never wanted to be a scientist, but I've got some deft fingers and a mind for security protocols... and when I see something I like, I take it. I've made a name for myself without a scientific breakthrough of my own.

Too bad thieving isn't the answer to this mess.

I worked in Herbert Research as a lab assistant, but really what I was doing was scalping research and selling it to labs back on Earth. Mars didn't have the restrictions Earth did on research, and a lot of researchers came to MPO with the intentions of doing research not allowed on Earth. Albert West was one of those hopeful scientists. He was experimenting on humans with nanomachines to cure some sort of Alzheimer's mutation. I worked with him for months, and saw a potential for more than just profit. The effects of one sample were... let's just say "too good to pass up."

I conducted a test of my own. I regret that I ever did. I should have never approached Murray.

[ffff00]I've trapped that bastard in his own panic room[-], but I've got a lot I need to get off my chest...[-][/i]
