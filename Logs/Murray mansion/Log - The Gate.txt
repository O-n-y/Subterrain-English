Woah... It's the size of an airlock! There's a few sticky notes near what I'm guessing are the controls. The first note is near a throw switch. The writing is sort of sloppy and smeared, but it's legible.

[i][ccccff]the gate won't get power unless
the power console at central reports all
contaminated and minerva samples[-][/i]

The second note was near the first, near the "OFF" light. The writing is more sloppy.

[i][ccccff]begin data collection via terminal and 
use equipment in Nilson to produce prototypes
install in all auxiliary locations
that have contamination[-][/i]

Another note was stuck to the lower half of the previous one.

[i][ccccff]ensure constant power to
prototypes to allow upload to RAID 0 storage
once finished, prototype transmitters
will activate and transmit
it will take time for this[-][/i]

The last note is barely clinging, hanging on the right side of the console. There's some raised indentations on the note.

[i][ccccff]they can control the others
they can't get out with these roaming around
it would end everything[-][/i]

There was some writing on the back.

[i][ccccff]please tell serafina and longin rascowicz
that murdoch says he's sorry[-][/i]
