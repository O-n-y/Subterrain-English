[ccccff][i]As it turns out, West’s work was more precise than we had realized. He wasn't designing this with eventual profit in mind. He wasn't some philanthropist hoping to cure everyone. Minerva was specially tuned to his own wife's particular case of dementia, which was apparently slightly “abnormal”. As a consequence, Minerva would never be fully effective on anyone else. Not in this state, at least. It seemed pointless to develop it further, but anyone on the project’s team that questioned Murray would be “reassigned” shortly after. I kept my mouth shut and my head down. I figured I’d rather pursue a pointless cure than end up in a cell like West. For weeks, we continued to test new samples in vain, fully aware that there was no end in sight. 

Murray eventually realized he was out of options: he had to bring Jennifer West to the colony to continue the project.

Things quickly got out of hand after she arrived. Murray had begun intervening personally, adjusting Minerva on his own. The new samples were much different from the ones we were working on. The new samples caused test subjects to rapidly mutate, destroying and creating new flesh constantly. This new form of life is perfectly suited for Mars, having no need for respiration and requiring minimal caloric energy to function. That's just the beginning, though. From what little I actually understood from our test sample date, the flesh comes back stronger with each “regeneration” cycle.

These creatures were not sentient, and they were more like beasts than humans. Murray kept mumbling his own term, though: Martian. The rest of the team and I began countermeasures behind his back, but it was way too late. He'd been planning this for some time. The best I could do was trap him in his panic room until someone could take him out. It doesn't make up for what I've done. I just pray that he doesn't eventually figure out a way to get out.[-][/i]
