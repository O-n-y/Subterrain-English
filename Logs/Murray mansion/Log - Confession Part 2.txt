[ccccff][i]The main selling point of West's nanomachines was how they operated. These little robots would be injected into a benign location and travel through the blood to the brain, on a mission to remove plaque and rebuild lost tissue. They self-propagated through the bloodstream, harvesting iron and other metals from blood cells to replicate. Self-propagating nanomachines and related research is strictly prohibited on Earth. West's sample was worth a fortune.

At first West was using synthesized flesh and brain matter to test, but he couldn't get accurate data without a living test subject. The robots were overzealous in their objective, and started breaking down flesh simply so it had something to repair. He scaled back the aggressiveness and limited how often they could replicate. He was taking it in the wrong direction. I could feel the cash slipping out of my fingers.

I [ff0000]framed[-] West, swapping a "failed" sample with his current test samples. It was perfect, except for one thing: he lived. I guess he's a bit more spry than he looks. Luckily, the murder of the test subject got him thrown in prison by Mars Security. Murray probably had something to do with that, now that I think about it. West was locked up tight, so I took the remaining samples and boxed them up, giving them a fancy name: [ffff00]"Minerva"[-].

Minerva was worth a lot in the hands of someone capable. I thought that "someone" was me.

I can't believe what an idiot I was.[-][/i]
