Wow... What is this place?

A corpse was on the ground. I recognized the uniform: Mars Security. Something was different, though. He wasn't wearing the regular name tags most guards do. He might be dead, but maybe his belongings can tell me something?

This guy didn't have a whole lot on him, but he did have a badge in his pocket. "Mars Security Division" is written across the front, "Bodyguard" written underneath MPO's seal. A bodyguard...? Out here? I can't think of anyone else that would need bodyguards, especially here. Well... except... 

My old boss. Jeff Murray.

This has to be Murray's "mansion". I heard a rumor, but it was so outlandish. Secret tunnels, private trams, teams of personnel that worked behind the scenes; it made Murray sound less like an entrepreneur, and more like a villain from a secret agent movie. Rascowicz used to brag about being invited here, but no one ever believed him. I guess it wasn't so far-fetched.

There wasn't any shuttle on the landing pad outside. He has to have escaped by now, and this bodyguard probably died escorting him out. Whatever this is made it all the way here, too. I wonder if there's anything here that will explain what the hell happened? Maybe I can find another way off Mars?
