[ccccff][i]I presented the research to Murray as if it were my own, but he knew I was full of shit. He knew why I was on Mars in the first place. I thought he’d report me to the board, strip me of my position in front of my peers, make an example of me… but he promoted me. He said he could trust me now, because now I knew who held my leash. That’s the thing you need to know about Murray: he only trusts people he can control.

He saw the results, and he wanted more. Obviously, I wasn’t able to do that, and the only guy who probably could was in prison. Murray tasked me to find capable researchers and assign them to the project. Maybe I was lucky that West fell into my lap in the first place, because none of the others even had a clue where to start with self-replicating nanomachines.

I don’t see why he’d want to push the research further, anyway. Minerva was good enough on its own to sell. It would have been worth a fortune to various labs back on Earth. These big-shot visionaries can't appreciate a proven business model; research is something you can get a huge return on if you sell it to everyone at the same time. I was getting paid pretty well, though. Eventually, I stopped protesting his decision to keep it. I was too busy enjoying the luxuries of Mars to care anymore.

I was getting what I wanted.

Murray wasn’t, though... it quickly became an obsession.[-][/i]
