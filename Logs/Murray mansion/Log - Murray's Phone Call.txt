[ccccff][i][ffffc0]Murray:[-]
 Hello, Doctor West. I've heard a lot about you!

[ffffc0]West:[-]
 Hello, Mr. Murray. Thank you for the invitation.

[ccccff][i][ffffc0]Murray:[-]
 Not at all, kid! So, tell me about this research
 you have proposed! You mentioned you have a way
 to create nanomachines that can indefinitely
 inhabit the body? What are you planning to do
 with something like that?
 
[ffffc0]West:[-]
 Well, Mr. Murray--
 
[ffffc0]Murray:[-]
 Oh, no need for that, kid. Jim is fine.
 
[ffffc0]West:[-]
 Oh, sure! Well, Jim, my wife has a disease I
 don't know how to fight without constant
 maintenance. She has Alzheimer's.
 
[ffffc0]Murray:[-]
 Can't she just do ultrasound? I mean, I've done
 it. Works wonders.
 
[ffffc0]West:[-]
 Unfortunately, she'd have to be in ultrasound
 indefinitely. She needs constant maintenance.
 Nanomachines could solve this in theory, but I
 can't move past just proposing it. It'll take a lot
 of money, a lot of test material, and everything
 about it is controversial and illegal. I'm probably
 already being monitored just talking about it
 over the phone.
 
[ffffc0]Murray:[-]
 I understand entirely, Dr. West. We can continue
 this conversation through a VPN link to my Earth
 offices. Please, head over there tomorrow and
 check in at reception. I think I can help you
 and your wife.
 
[ffffc0]West:[-]
 Really? Thank you, Jim! I'll be over first thing
 tomorrow!
 
[ffffc0]Murray:[-]
 Glad to hear it, kid. Don't keep me waiting!
