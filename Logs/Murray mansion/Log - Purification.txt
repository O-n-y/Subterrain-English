Murray's been tuning Minerva to colder climates and environments with little to no oxygen. He says it's to cut down on oxidation damage and overclock the nanomachines without risk, but I don't understand why. Minerva's for living things, after all, and I sure as hell like breathing and being warm. He won't even let any of us touch the AI software anymore. The rest of us on the "Minerva" team are stuck with test sample reports with the occasional request to support the other research teams. My team knows what Minerva can do, and that thought he's changing it behind closed doors makes us uncomfortable. One day Minerva be too difficult to contain.

We've been working to "battle" Minerva during off duty hours, or in between our tasks during the day. We discovered that if we broadcast interfering signals on the same frequencies that the nanomachines communicate with, we can dampen Minerva's rate of spread and evolution. It won't stop it, but it's something. 

We've poked around the systems in the basement, and Dr. Cameron thinks we can modify the noisy mainframe there to monitor the situation with some modifications. He thinks, in time, we can use the mainframe to collect communication data in order to sabotage their replication and cause self-destruction.

I guess it's up to me now. The only way [ffff00]purification[-] will occur is if I can manage to pull this together. I'm not so sure I can.[-]
