Hector and Nora are missing. Murray said they "quit". I'm thinking they're dead. We have a mole, I think. They can't be very close to the source, since I'm still here. We're going to have to make a move.

We got new a new group of researchers to replace Hector and Nora, along with a few others that worked in the other secret projects. It's taking less and less time to convince the new people how thin of a tightrope we're walking with all the Minerva test subjects around.

Murray's been sending out security teams to try to recover a bunch of software for the facilities at Nilson. He made a pretty angry phone call to to Agatha, that old witch I used to work under in Herbert. I guess that lady's gone nuts since someone stole her cats. I guess that's why some other researchers went missing a few days back: those chips were never supposed to go out. A "security risk" or something. Meanwhile, the same guy worrying about software is making zombie mutants in a lab.

We have to make a move. Murry's guards were sniffing around my lab's secret stash. I can't be caught! I don't have any idea what they'd do to me! 

Dr. Cameron finished with the hardware for the purification device, but it'll be for nothing by the end of the day. Lassiter agrees that we need to take Murray out, but he says there's no way he'd be able to sneak a gun in, and we'd all basically get executed out of suspicion for collusion. We gotta fake out the security team and make him retreat to his bunker out of fear. After that, we can trap him. Dr. Kan finished with that upgrade a while back for central control's computer, so everything's in place for the lockdown. I have an idea.

Cait and James know how to rig the shuttle's navigation software to be remote controlled via communications. The plan is to have the shuttle take off and blast the airlock using some plastic explosives smuggled from the guard room.

We trapped them. Cait and James are dead, though. Dr. Cameron got stuck inside with his assistants. It was quiet for a while, but then we heard screaming and a monstrous thing. I thought Murray was dead, but then I heard him over the door's intercom, as if nothing happened.
