Upon entering the room, I noticed a massive bulletin on the wall.

[ffffc0]Bulletin:[-]
[ccccff][i]
As of today 2300 hours, I am assuming full control over the biosphere.

All biological specimens previously listed as being in violation of health code directives 3, 7, and 14 must be placed in the incinerator by 05:00 tomorrow.

I'm taking command due to what I consider to be gross negligence among the biosphere staff and leadership.

Follow my directives to the letter and we will not have any further problems.

Dr. Tayama is being taken to a secure location for enhanced questioning.

All necessary equipment including [ffff00]data chips[-] will be moved to my storage facility in the [ffff00]Plaza.[-]

If you have any questions, you will know where to find me.

Dr. Tayama has been taken out?
