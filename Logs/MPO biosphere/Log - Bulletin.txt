Upon entering the room, I noticed a massive bulletin on the wall.

[ffffc0]Attention: Biosphere Staff
April 7th, 2053[-] 
[ccccff][i]
As of 23:00 hours today, I have relieved Dr. Tayama of all leadership responsibilities. Negligence or incompetence will no longer be tolerated at the biosphere. Due to a lack of cooperation, Dr. Tayama will be taken to a secure location for enhanced interrogation techniques.

All biological specimens previously listed as being in violation of health code directives 3, 7, and 14 must be placed in the incinerator by 05:00 tomorrow. Any biosphere staff caught with specimens that violate these directives will be dealt with accordingly.

All sensitive equipment, including [ffff00]data chips[-], are to be confiscated. Due to the biosphere's history of negligence, confiscated equipment will be moved to my storage facility in the [ffff00]Plaza[-] until things shape up around here. Staff caught with confiscated equipment will be joining Dr. Tayama.

As long as my instructions are followed, I'm sure we can get along and root out all the filth.

If you have any questions, you know where to find me.

          - Zeronica Jones.

Dr. Tayama was taken in for "enhanced interrogation techniques"...?
