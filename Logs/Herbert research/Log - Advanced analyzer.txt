Advanced spectrum analyzer center.

This is the place where I spent most of my time while working on Mars.

These super AI Nano-machines can analyze the molecular structure of the subjects and then feed that data to the engineering bay.

The engineers then use the data to copy the subject.  The AI is able to perform advanced analysis and make it's own improvements upon the subject.  In some cases, the copied subjects came out far superior to the original.

Human subjects are not tested yet, but I knew some of my old colleague were very interested in that.

I can probably still operate them. [ffff00]Using one of these will consume the subject[-] of research so I must be careful not to destroy any critical objects that I need to survive.
