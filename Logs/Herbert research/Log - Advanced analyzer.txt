The advanced spectrum analyzer center.

I spent a lot of time here when I was working on my research. There are two research systems here: one specialized for biological research, and one for technological research. Each research system makes use of a tiny network of nanomachines to [ffff00]break down[-] inserted samples into [ffff00]"blueprints"[-] that can be used to fabricate exact copies. It's an absolutely ingenious idea; I even borrowed some of the ideas behind its design for my own research.

Since whatever I put in the machines here is [ffff00]lost[-] when processed, I shouldn't put anything in that I currently need to survive, like an oxygen canister, unless I'm willing to wait until I can make a new one.
 
These systems are also networked to a "thinktank" AI that specializes in [ffff00]improving designs[-]. I should see if I can make improved equipment by scanning some of the things I've found. Blueprints can also be fed into the machine manually, should I find any. It confuses the machine a little bit, but eventually the AI figures out it's supposed to be reading instructions rather than making an exact copy of those instructions.

All of this data is uploaded to a database that the [ffff00]3D printer[-] and [ffff00]bio combiner[-] in Nilson Engineering can access. I can use the facilities to make copies of objects I've researched or the improvements the thinktank AI has made.

Well, let's see if I still know how to use this thing...
