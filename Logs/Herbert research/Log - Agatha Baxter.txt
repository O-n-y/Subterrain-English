  I need that research data chip back.  
  I know you're a competent researcher.
  Nobody's questioning that.

  But... some of your more... questionable 
  methods have been getting out of hand 
  lately. I need it back. 

  I'm asking just this
  once.

[ffffc0]Baxter:[-]
  No!! And my methods are NONE of your business!!

[ffffc0]Murray:[-]
  I'm afraid they are. That's how this
  relationship works. You're a liability,
  Agatha.

[ffffc0]Baxter:[-]
  Too bad! It's not even here, baldy!
  The chip is with my sweet baby,
  Mittens.

  I left it with my little Mittens because 
  she never trusts anyone. 
  She's such a good kitty-cat.

  She's such a cutie, the way she pops in and out of
  vents, like a little meerkat! My itty-bitty
  kitty-mole!

  I told Mittens to never lose it, so I know she's 
  going to do a good job! She'll hide it far away
  from your gross face! You'll never find her!

[ffffc0]Murray:[-]
   I guess it would be unsettling for you to 
   hear that I already know that fleabag is
   somewhere in [ffff00]Viking Square[-].
   And that I have a new violin that needs
   to be stringed.

[ffffc0]Baxter:[-]
  YOU. WOULDN'T. DARE.[/i][-]
