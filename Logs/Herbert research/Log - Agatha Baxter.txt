  I need that Data Chip.  
  I know you are a competent research scientist.
  Nobody would ever say otherwise.

  But some of your more... detrimental habits have
  been getting out of hand lately.

[ffffc0]Baxter:[-]
  111!!!11!!!  no!!!!  My methods are none of your business!

[ffffc0]Murray:[-]
  I'm afraid they are, that's how the boss-employee relationship works.

[ffffc0]Baxter:[-]
  Well, it's too bad because I don't even keep them in 
  my office. The chip is inside of my little baby boo 
  Mittens.

  I left it with Mittens because she never trusts
  anyone.  She's such a good kitty-witty.

  Last I saw, she had headed back to the [ffff00]Square[-]
  where I found her. Probably deep in the crawlspace 
  by now.

  It took hours of careful surgery to implant the chip, 
  so good luck getting it even if you DO find her.
  hahaha.

[ffffc0]Murray:[-]
  Five minutes with a Swiss army knife should do the
  trick.

  you... wouldn't... dare...[/i][-]
