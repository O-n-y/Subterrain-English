  Is the prototype blueprint secure?

[ffffc0]Johnathan:[-]
  Yeah, we got a hold of it, it's being stored in my lab 
  at the [ffff00]Carson hotel[-], it's under lock and key,
  only you and me have the [ffff00]keycards[-] to access it.

[ffffc0]Merrick:[-]
  Good, we can't have any screw ups with this. 
  This is a top-secret order from Commander 
  Sheridan.

  This design is one of a kind; if anything happens to it
  we're screwed. You know what happens to people
  that can't follow orders.

  We're leaving asap. Emergency evacuation of the 
  Mars colony has been announced, some yahoo is 
  talking about an infection. 

  Prepare the package to be picked up and be ready 
  to jump on the first evac out of here.

[ffffc0]Johnathan:[-]
  Alright, understood, I'm headed out to pick it up.

[ffffc0]Merrick:[-]
  And remember either you come to the shuttle with 
  the package, or not at all.
