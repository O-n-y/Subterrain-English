[ccccff][i][ffffc0]Merrick:[-]
  Is the blueprint of the prototype secure?

[ffffc0]Johnathan:[-]
  Yeah, I got a hold of it. I've stowed it in my private 
  lab at the [ffff00]Carson Hotel[-]. I've patched my
  door's security flaw. Those hacked keycards
  floating around won't work on it. 
  
  Only our [ffff00]keycards[-] will work. I guarantee it.

[ffffc0]Merrick:[-]
  Okay... good. We can't screw this up. I want to
  be absolutely sure it doesn't get recovered. 
  Sheridan would have our asses if anyone even
  knows about this. If someone found the damn thing,
  we'd be ejected into space.

  We're leaving ASAP. They've announced an
  evacuation, some sort of outbreak or some shit.
  Don't get distracted by it, this blueprint is the only
  copy. We need to [f04030]wipe the research database[-]
  before we leave. They don't want anything left if
  Earth gets involved before the situation is resolved.

  We need to pick it up before we evacuate.

[ffffc0]Johnathan:[-]
  Alright, understood. I'll head out and pick it up now.

[ffffc0]Merrick:[-]
  Remember, Johnathan: don't bother showing up if
  you don't have the blueprint! None of us are going
  anywhere without it! And delete your call logs this
  time, dammit![/i][-]
