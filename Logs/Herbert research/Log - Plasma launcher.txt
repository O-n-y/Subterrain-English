  Is the prototype blueprint secure?

[ffffc0]Johnathan:[-]
  yeah, we got a hold of it, it's being stored in my lab 
  at the [ffff00]Carson hotel[-], it's under lock and key,
  only you and me have the [ffff00]keycards[-] to access it.

[ffffc0]Merrick:[-]
  good, we can't have any screw ups with this. 
  this is a top-secret order from Commander Sheridan.

  This design is one of a kind; if anything happens to it,
  we're screwed. you know what happens to people that
  can't follow orders. 

  We're leaving asap. emergency evacuation of the mars colony 
  has been announced, some yayhoo is talking about infection. prepare 
  the package to be picked up, be ready to move on the first 
  evac out of here.

[ffffc0]Johnathan:[-]
  alright, understood, I'm headed out to pick it up.

[ffffc0]Merrick:[-]
  And remember either you come to the shuttle with the package,
  or not at all.
