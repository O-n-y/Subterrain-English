Herbert research.

This is where I used to work. I was really excited back then...

Now it's empty, except for the sounds of whatever lurks in the dark corridors.

Dwelling on the past is not going to help me right now.

There are some advanced [ffff00]spectrum analyzers[-] in the middle of this facility.

There are also living quarters to the south west.  If I look there, maybe I can find some [ffff00]key cards[-] to the other places connected to Central Control.

I wonder if any of my old colleagues are kicking around?  Not likely.  To hell with them anyway.  If anyone were responsible for this outbreak, it would have to be them.
