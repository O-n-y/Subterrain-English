Herbert Research. I can't say it's good to be back, at least in these circumstances. Not that I'd be working here again if they let me out at some point.

Man... it's so quiet. I don't see Agatha rambling in her office, nor do I see Merrick or Johnathan whispering to each other in the halls. Rascowicz isn't strutting around. Dr. Kan isn't lounging in his regular seat by the bio research system. There's some shuffling echoing down the halls every so often. My mind's playing tricks on me.

...I think.

There are a pair of advanced [ffff00]research systems[-] on the north side of this facility. I should find out if they are still working. They will be extremely useful if they are.

Our living quarters were in the southwest section of the facility. If I look there, maybe I can find some [ffff00]keycards[-] to the other places connected to Central Control or some clues to what's going on. It's the research department! Someone had to have noticed something!
