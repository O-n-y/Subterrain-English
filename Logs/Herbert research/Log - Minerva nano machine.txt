[ccccff][i]You'll never guess what I snagged off of Dr. West, pal.

I consider myself a connoisseur of good science. You have to be if you're in my line of work. Now that I've got my hands on something interesting, the real work for us is about to begin.

This nanomachine design is going to make me rich. I just gotta find a buyer. He never named it, though. I'm going to call it "Minerva." Even the name sounds expensive, right? Maybe it'll make it easier for us to sell since it sounds like some sort of designer bullshit. I think I may be able to find a buyer right under my nose, though. If he buys, I'm getting a 90% cut this time! Got it?!

Hah, poor, poor Dr. West. I wonder what would have happened if he didn't have his little "accident"? I bet his wife is a vegetable by now![/i][-]

Rascowicz! I knew I shouldn't have trusted him! How could my research even be of use to him? Who would want an unfinished product for a disease only one person has?

I wonder who he's planning on selling it to?
