[ccccff][i]That Dr. West...  Such a good scientist.  I consider myself a connoisseur of good science.  You have to be, when you're a research thief.  Now that the heavy lifting is all done, my work can begin...

This nano-machine is going to make me rich.  "Minerva."  The name is important.  Needs to look good flying across the stock ticker.  

Kind of a shame that West can't be here to enjoy the success.  That goody-two-shoes would probably start lecturing me about "ethics" or some bull. What a hypocrite... Never liked him....  [/i][-]


Rascalwitz!  I knew I shouldn't have trusted him!  But what is Minerva?  What is he talking about!?  How could my research even be of use to him?  If he knows this much, then he must know that it's not going to be useful to anyone but myself...
