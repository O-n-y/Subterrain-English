[ccccff][i]Honey, I'll be home late.  The employees all chipped in to throw me some kind of party.

I know, it's a pain...  But that is the cost of greatness.

You have to make time for all the little people who just want to be close to you and celebrate how much light you bring into their pathetic lives.

Anyway, the shindig is happening at this house in the Aries district.  Don't wait up for me.[/i][-]
