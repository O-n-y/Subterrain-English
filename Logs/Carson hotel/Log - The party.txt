[ccccff][i]Hi honey, 

I'll be home late. The employees all chipped in to throw me some kind of party. I know, I know, it's sudden. That is the cost of greatness, though; you have to make time for all the little people who just want to be close to you! They just want to celebrate how much light I'm bringing to their pathetic lives. It's no big deal.

I think you should sit this one out. The party is at this dumpy apartment in the [ffff00]Aries District[-], and I'd rather not have you suffer that AND wade through lesser people the entire time. I'm not sure when I'll be back. My employees love me, and I have a feeling they won't want me to leave once I get there, so don't wait up!

XOXO
