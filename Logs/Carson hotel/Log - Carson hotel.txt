The Carson Hotel at Mars.  Like a lot of off-world businesses, Burlington Intergalactic made their first step with orbital hotels.

Using that success as a stepping-stone, naturally the next move would have to be Mars.

The most popular package was a week-long all-inclusive stay at the Carson resort, and a hike up the tallest mountain in the solar system: Olympus Mons.

Aided by mechanical sherpas and powered space suits, the climb takes approximately 30 minutes.

It's a very time-efficient way to prove your masculinity, but still not as badass as killing a lion.

All of this was overshadowed by the presence of Becky Burlington, daughter of Wayne Burlington, and heiress to the Burlington fortune.

Recently she had been in the spotlight because of her out-of-control party lifestyle and multiple drug arrests.  In an effort to clean up her image, she had taken a vacation to Mars.

While the media had expected her presence on Mars to be punctuated by the same stories of drug binges and party-girl antics...  nobody had heard from her in years.
