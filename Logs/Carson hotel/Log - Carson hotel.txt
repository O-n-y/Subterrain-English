The Carson Hotel of Mars MPO. 

Like a lot of off-world corporations, Burlington Intergalactic made their first foray into extra-planetary business with orbital hotels. They were wildly successful, and the fortune they amassed lead to a more exotic target for the hotel: Mars.

Tourism sprang up the moment the Carson Hotel opened for business. The most popular package was a week long all-inclusive stay at the Carson, including a hike up the tallest mountain in the solar system: Olympus Mons.

Even when aided by mechanical guides and powered EVA suits, the climb takes approximately 4 hours. I never had the patience for that, but people went crazy for it. "Climb Olympus Mons," was a selling point for a trip to Mars in itself for most folks.

All of this, however, was overshadowed by the presence of Becky Burlington. Socialite, celebrity, and heiress to the Burlington fortune, Becky was known as "Princess" to most of her staff. 

Becky also had a problem staying out of the spotlight. She partied pretty hard and was always ending up on tabloid sites for drug use, soliciting, or off-color comments. In an effort to clean up her image and protect his own, her father, Wayne, sent her to Mars for "rehab."

The media had expected her presence on Mars to be punctuated by the same party-girl antics or drug fueled rants on social media. No one’s heard from her or seen her in years, though.
