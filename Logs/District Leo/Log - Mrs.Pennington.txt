[ccccff][i]Your Mars Scout cookies are here!
Two boxes of mint chocolate and two boxes of rag-tags.
Also, you left your briefcase here last time. It's kind of heavy, so I'll just leave it with the cookies!

Come by our place in the [ffff00]Gemini District[-] to get your stuff![/i][-]

Mars Scout cookies? Never heard of those. I wonder what they dropped off?
