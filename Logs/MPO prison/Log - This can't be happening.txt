This can't be happening.

There are dead bodies everywhere! But they are not just dead. The bodies have been ripped apart, almost as if mauled by animals. And the blood! There is blood everywhere!

Is anyone alive in here? What happened? Just what the hell is happening here?

I wish it was just a bad dream, or a hallucination. But my hunger and thirst is very real.


I'm in a living nightmare, and I have no choice but to live through whatever horrors await me.
