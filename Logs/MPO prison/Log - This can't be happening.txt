This... can't be happening...

The floor is littered with corpses. None of them appear to have been stabbed, beaten, or shot though. All of the bodies have been ripped into, some much worse than others. Blood's everywhere, including the ceiling!

What the hell happened?!

I wish I could chalk this up as a dream, but my hunger and thirst are as real as they ever were. I'm in a living nightmare... I just haven't seen the monster yet.
