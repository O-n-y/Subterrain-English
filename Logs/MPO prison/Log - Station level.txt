I made it to the administrative level of the prison, but I haven't seen a single person. Well, no one that's still breathing, anyway...

The administrative area is where visitation and clerical work of the prison takes place, but it's also the main entrance to the prison. I was carted in here by the tram... I wonder if it's still operational. I might want to check out the oxygen and thermal regulation systems while I'm here, too; chances are, I'll need to know what those look like if I ever need to do repairs.

From the look of this place, though... all hell's broken loose. I don't think there will be any guards in here considering what I've seen so far. Hopefully, there's still a weapon laying around here somewhere in case whatever's done this is still lurking around.

...I hope security measures aren't online anymore...
