I made it to the transport level of the prison, but I still haven't seen a living person.

The transport level has a visitor's meeting room and other important facilities like oxygen and temperature regulators, but most importantly it has a tram station that is connected to the rest of the Mars colony.

That is probably where I should heading to, but I should also search for supplies along the way. 

It seems like all hell has broken loose, I'll need to be on my toes.

The question is whether or not the security measures will still be active. Given the situation, I doubt there are any guards left to stop me.
