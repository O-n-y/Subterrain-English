I've finally made it to the tram station.

Incredibly, there was a fully operational tram. It never left for Central Control...

No surprise, given the situation.  Prisoners and guards are all dead.


I don't know where to go but I am not staying here. 

If I can just get to the Space center or Central control... Maybe I can find out what is going on.

There could be survivors, or at least some supplies... something to eat.
