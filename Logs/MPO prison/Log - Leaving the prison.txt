I've finally made it to the prison's rail station. Incredibly, there was a fully operational tram. It never left for wherever it was headed.

I guess the evacuation never even made it past the station.

Power seems to be flowing to the prison district, but there's no telling how long it'll be before it gets knocked out... or if whatever did this will be back. I don't want to find out.

Central Control was the "heart" of MPO, so there's probably plenty of supplies I can gather there, maybe even other survivors to make contact with.

...And perhaps something to eat, too.
