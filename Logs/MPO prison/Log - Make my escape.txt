God... how long have I been in here? It must have been days since I've last eaten.

My head feels like it's about to pop, and my tongue feels like a dry hunk of beef jerky.

I can barely stand... but I've gotta drag myself up one more time. I can't let it end here. I've got to at least try.

Obviously, the door's not something I can pry open by myself in this state. The vent is the only option at this point. The air circulation fan is slowing down, so there's a chance the "anti-tampering" measures don't have enough juice to be an issue anymore. Should be easy enough to force the vent open if I'm not getting shocked.

I better get moving. If emergency power fails, I'll be dead before I can even figure out what's going on.
