God... How long have I been asleep? It's all so quiet... 


I feel like my head is going to burst.  Mouth is dry as an old piece of lunch meat...


No strength... But I gotta drag myself up one more time.  Have to find a way out of here, somehow...  Have to try...


Okay... So two options.  Either I force the door open, or check the ventilation hatch.  Maybe the security is offline.


Either way I have to move. Only so much air left. I gotta get moving while I still can.
