[ccccff][i]Dear Jeff, bro remember that time we were smoking up and you were all like, 'dude, what if there was something like food... but... better?'

I jacked your idea, bro!

Started making these Better Bars here in the stash house.

I call them Better Bars because they're like food bars but you know.... better.

Each one has all the calories and nutrients you need for like two or three days.

On the real, your regular food is just whack compared to these.

I can't get anyone to eat them except for the cats, and to do that I have to spike it with some dank marsmali.

Most heinous...

I got some interest with some military guys on Earth, made them so dense they repel bullets and lasers and shit.

Hahahaha, your bro did something right! Also, hey don't use from our stash man. Not cool. The stash is for paying customers only.

Help yourself to a bar if you get the munchies. But don't eat the one with the [f04030]red mark[-]. Unless you like the taste of data chip, cause that's where I hid that one you found.

Oh and there is this one thing...

Your bro is a genius, but he kind of borked the lemon on this one... So, like, if they don't get eaten quickly enough, this totally nasty gas builds up in the package.  Be careful opening them, or they will let one rip on your face hehehe.[/i][-]

SO, there's a data chip inside one of these Better Bar packages, but I better be careful and open the right one...
