[ccccff][i]Jeff,

First off, dude, I saw you took from the stash. Not cool, man. The stash is off limits until we break even. I'll let it slide, but only because of what I'm about to tell you... it'll make us beaucoup bucks.

So, remember that time we were smoking, and you were all like, "Dude, what if there was something like food, but, like... better?"

I just jacked your idea, dude!

I started making these "Better Bars" here in the safe house. I call 'em "Better Bars" because they're like food bars, but, you know... better.

Each one has all the nutrients and stuff you need for like two or three days, bro! For real! You could cut down on eating, make room for tokin'! One problem though... they taste like ass. I can't even get the cats to eat them without spiking them with some Marsmari.

I got some military dudes interested, but... not as food. I found out these things are pretty dense when you pile them up. Two or three of them piled up will resist lasers n' bullets n' shit! So, not so good for food, but plenty good for armor! I guess I did something right, man!

Help yourself to a bar if you get curious, 'cause I doubt you'll want to eat it. Don't open the one with the [f04030]red mark[-], though! I'm [ffff00]hiding something[-] in there from another score. I'll fill you in with the details later.

Oh, and there is one other thing...

So, like, there's another problem I didn't tell the military dudes about. Better Bars, uh, "expire" pretty quickly. And violently. Be careful opening them, or it might just blow up in your face! Haha!

...But seriously, be careful, bro.[/i][-]
