[ccccff][i]Keepin' it 100, I started this with good intentions.

I thought it'd be one little cut and I could get the Data chip out.

You ever try cutting open a live cat?

Them little guys is hard to hang onto, and plus Baxter put that Data chip in there deep.

Was a good idea on paper, but in the future let's just leave the chips inside the cats.  On the real, my conscience can't take this.[/i][-]
