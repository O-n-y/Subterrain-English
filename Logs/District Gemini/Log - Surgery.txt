[ccccff][i]I thought this was a good plan. Instead, all it did was piss off that Baxter bitch real good. Now, it's sleeping in my lap like I'm some kind o' movie villain.

I grabbed it after that ol' crone called, but it didn't resist. It looked right at me as I held it up with these big green eyes that looked just like Jazz's eyes when I was a kid. It was like she came back in another cat so she could meet me.

How the hell am I supposed to gut this thing now?

Plan's changed. Cutting it opened would have been easier, but I'll keep the chip in the cat until I can figure out a way to get out safely. No way I'm losing this little guy, though.[/i][-]
