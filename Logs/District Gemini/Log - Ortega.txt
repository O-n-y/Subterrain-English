[ccccff][i][ffffc0]Boss Ortega:[-]  
  Baxter, you dried up ol' nag. I think I know why 
  you's calling. Spit it out, already.

[ffffc0]Baxter:[-]
  ...

[ffffc0]Boss Ortega:[-]
  I guess cat got ya tongue, eh? Heheh.
  I'm sure you know one of ya's furry
  pals is missin'. Good news: I found her.  

[ffffc0]Baxter:[-]
  How. Dare. You. YOU-- 

[ffffc0]Boss Ortega:[-]
  Now, now... that's not ladylike. What
  kind o' mother is you's? I've done you
  a favor.
  
  I'm just a simple, concerned citizen who just
  happened to find a poor, lost animal.

  Good thing too, seeing as she has a 
  special gift under her skin. Any good
  samaritan would help this creature. 
        
  I'm thinkin' a "finder's fee" is in order.
  Come to my office in the [ffff00]Pisces District[-]. 
  And if you can't pay, well... that's okay. 
  I'll still send Mr. Wiggles back to you.

  One paw at a time... heheh...

[ffffc0]Baxter:[-]
  You. YOU!! YOU GO-- Ortega.

  I'm coming for you, Ortega.

  Bring all the goons you need. I don't care.
  I'm done. That was it. ORTEGAAAA--[/i][-]
