  Baxter, you old witch.  I think I know why you are
  calling.

[ffffc0]Boss Ortega:[-]
  I can guess from your silence that you have noticed
  one of your furry friends is... missing.
  Well, the good news is that I found her.  

[ffffc0]Baxter:[-]
  How...  Dare...  You...  

[ffffc0]Boss Ortega:[-]
  Now don't you stop being lady-like...
  
  I'm just a simple concerned citizen who just
  happened to find a lost animal.

  And it's a good thing too, seeing as she has a 
  special data chip implanted under her skin.
		
  I think a finder's fee is in order. Come to my office
  at [ffff00]Pisces district[-]. And if you can't pay, well... 
  That's okay. I'll send Mr. Wiggles back to you.

  One paw at a time...

[ffffc0]Baxter:[-]
