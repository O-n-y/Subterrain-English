I have found the mine excavator and its software bay.

That's odd... only basic software is installed? Regardless, I'll need to install better software in order to excavate other types of ore.

This place is operated by the Bigelow Mining Company... The same one that owns the [ffff00]Solar Casino[-]. Maybe I can find more information on a [ffff00]software upgrade[-] there?
