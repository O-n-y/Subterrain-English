I have found the mine excavator and its software upgrade console.

It looks like I need a higher level of software in order to excavate other types of ore.


There are only two options.  Either I find the software or find a data chip so that I can analyze and produce one.

This place is operated by the Biggelow Mining Company... The same Biggelow that owns the Casino. I think he's got an office there too.
