[ccccff][i]Captain Roger!

If you find this note, just head back to the shuttle! I busted my phone when I threw it at one of those dude's heads! I wish I could call you!

There's way too many of those ugly weirdos to deal with, and they're really angry, bro! There's also not a lot here to snatch, bro, just a bunch of stupid rocks! I know you said not to, but I'm going to pick up some snacks in the [ffff00]Plaza[-]. I think we'll need 'em! Road trips need snacks, bro! You'll understand what I'm talking about when I bring you a choco pie!

After I load up on grub, I'll meet you at the shuttle, I promise! And don't worry, bro, I still have that [ffff00]keycard[-]. I know you said it was the only one!

Your pal,
Martin

PS: Beat up some of these weirdos for me, bro![/i][-]
