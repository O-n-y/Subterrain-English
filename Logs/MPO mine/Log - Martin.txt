[ccccff][i]Captain Roger!

If you find this note, get out of here.

Too many of those ugly weirdos to deal with.

Not worth trying to load up on Mars rocks for the trip home.

I'm going to pick up some snacks in the [ffff00]Plaza.[-]

Road trips are a drag without a good supply of snacks.

After I get loaded up I'll meet you at the shuttle.

I got that [ffff00]keycard[-] so don't worry.

Nothing could possibly go wrong.  Peace-out bro.
