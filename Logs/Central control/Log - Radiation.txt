While I was exploring the generator room, I have found some hallways that lead somewhere.

But the area has been made toxic by the radiation!

I looks like it has been done deliberately to prevent someone or something from coming through it. Obviously they didn't finish the job! The whole thing is just a mess...

I don't think I should try to go through that, I have a feeling that if I do, I won't survive for more than a few seconds.

I am not sure what is on the other side of the hallways, but I should be prepared to protect the generator just in case.
