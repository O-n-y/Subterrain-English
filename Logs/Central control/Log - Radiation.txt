While I was exploring the generator, I found hallways branching off in all directions. It seems containers of radioactive materials have been spilled. I shouldn't get any closer or finding my way out of here will be the least of my problems.

...It's somewhat unsettling that all three hallways have had the same "accident."

Whatever the case, these hallways leave the generator vulnerable. There's no doors to close off should something come down this way.
