[ccccff][i]What the hell is Director Worlick thinking?! Why in the hell would we all head to the space center if Central's got the most advanced purification ventilation system in all of MPO?! "Just following orders," my ass! I can't believe this!

I mean, it's a four stage ULPA filtration system with an ionizer/activated carbon prestage! Literally NOTHING can permeate. Oxygen barely passes through this thing! We haven't had one case of contamination originate here, everyone that's shown symptoms has been outside of Central! But, no, we're going to be "escorted" to Murray Space Center, even though there's only two working shuttles. Sounds like a deathwish to me.

I'm not moving from this spot unless they're pointing a GIO at my head.[/i][-]
