The tram brought me to Central Control without any issues. Everything seems fine... it's rather odd, actually.

I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I arrived, but I didn't expect silence. Central tends to be swarming with people; hovering over terminals, talking through the corridors, guards posted up at doorways. Instead, it's a ghost town.

The good news is that the oxygen generator seems to be running. Otherwise, I would have suffocated as soon as I opened the tram doors. Hopefully, most of MPO is in similar shape. Maybe I can check the status of each district's life support systems somewhere in Central Control.

First thing's first: I better check on the reactor. Central Control is where power is monitored and distributed through MPO. The reactor's in a secured area, but it's literally down the hall. I can easily access it should it need maintenance. I'll need to keep the reactor in working order, as the entire colony is dependent on the power supplied from this location to keep life support online. On top of that, the tram doesn't seem to be able to access any location that doesn't have power, so I'll have to keep that in mind.

I should explore the area and search for supplies. But most importantly, I should look out for the [ffff00]power control console[-]. It's got to be around here somewhere. Murray Space Center's lost power, but if I can reconnect it, I might be able to find a way out of here... or, better yet, off Mars.
