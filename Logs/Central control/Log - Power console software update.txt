[ccccff][i]I have finished upgrading the software of the power console display to indicate the effects that oxygen and temperature are having on the rate of infection.

Dr.Kan was right about this. It seems as though [ffff00]low oxygen[-] and [ffff00]cold temperature[-] speeds up the infection rate.

The correlation between these factors is not understood. And those Frankensteinesque scientists aren't forthcoming in their notes.  Am I the only professional in this zoo?  Sigh, I guess I just have to keep my nose to the grindstone and finish running these procedures.


Someone mentioned a mass evacuation soon.  And here I am, unable to pull away from my work.  Why can't security just do their job already?  Am I the only one that does their job around here?


Oh well, who knows what's going to happen. I don't really care.[/i][-]
