This has got to be the power control console. As usual, there's no one here either.

I should be able to control the flow of power for the colony from here as well as monitor the generator's current status. The generator's not operating at full capacity, so I should be careful when connecting additional sectors to the power grid. I could overload the reactor if I draw too much power. If I do, it'll overheat and probably initiate an emergency shutdown sequence. 

That would be bad - I could end up stranded if I'm not careful! And what's worse, working [ffff00]oxygen filters[-] and [ffff00]temperature regulators[-] can't function without power! A blackout means certain death, as far as I'm concerned.

I can't just sit here, though. I'll have to power up other locations to gather supplies and gather information if I want to get out of here.

There's a lot of consoles around here. If I [ffff00]search[-] them, I might be able to find some information.
