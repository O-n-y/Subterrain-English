I have found the power control console. There seems to be nobody here.

I should be able to control the power output of the colony from here.

I am not sure how much power the generator can handle, so I should be careful not to connect too many locations. 

Otherwise it might overheat and shut down. It would be really bad news if there were to be a massive black-out while I was exploring out there.

I'll need to connect the power to locations that I want to travel to, because the tram runs on the same power grid.

Also, any disconnected locations will lose their ability to generate oxygen and regulate the temperature so I should be aware of that.

There seems to be some operation consoles around here. If I [ffff00]search[-] them I might be able to find some information.
