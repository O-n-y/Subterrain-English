It looks like there's nobody here, living or otherwise. 

Everyone seems to have evacuated, and whatever did this isn't around either. I guess this place is safe, for now. I may as well set up my basecamp here. This would be a good place to stage my escape.

Fortunately for me, most of the important facilities for MPO are within walking distance of Central Control. I don't even need to power up those sections to reach them. 

I could probably reboot the 3D printer and other facilities at [ffff00]Nilson Engineering[-], maybe even print out some supplies I need. 

[ffff00]Herbert Research[-], where I used to work, has research equipment I could use to feed instructions to the systems in Nilson. 

I'll probably have to use the excavator at the [ffff00]Mine[-] to gather materials for the 3D printer.

I should also check out the [ffff00]Biosphere[-]. I could probably use the agricultural systems there to supply the bio combiner at Nilson Engineering, maybe even sustain myself.

I should check out each location and see if I can figure out what's going on. At the very least, if I can get these facilities restarted, I can prepare myself for the worst. There are a few staircases leading to these areas somewhere around here... I'm sure I'll recognize them again once I see them.
