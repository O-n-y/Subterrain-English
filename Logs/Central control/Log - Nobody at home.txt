It looks like there is nobody at Central control.

Everyone seems to have either evacuated or died. 

But there also doesn't seem to be any infected around either.

That is good news just in case it takes longer than I expect to find my way off of this planet.

At least while I am in the Central control, I should be out of immediate danger.

This would be a good place to make my stand.

After all, this area is the only place that has a direct connection to the other important facilities such as research and engineering.

Speaking of which, I should gather some supplies and try to explore those areas. If I remember it correctly, I think they were

Herbert research, Nilson engineering, MPO mine, and MPO biosphere

Even if I don't find any supplies or information I should still be able to use the facilities in them... if they are still working.
