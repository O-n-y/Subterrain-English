I have found my way into the power generation room.

This technology is one of humanity's most remarkable achievements.

The fusion drive runs almost endlessly via a core inertia engine.  While it doesn't generate quite as much energy as a fission based generator, what it produces is clean and reliable.

This is one of many reasons why the colonization of Mars was possible.

I don't give two shits what MPO does but I have to give credit to the engineers of MPO on this one!


Upon closer examination, it seems like the generator has been slightly damaged. It looks stable, but it has confirmed my suspicion about the constant capacity drops.

This is alarming. It means that the power won't stay on as for long as I had hoped. Sooner or later the power level is going to drop to the point where it will only be able to sustain Central Control.

It looks like the [ffff00]generator modules[-] that it uses to regulate the power are degrading faster than normal due to the damage. The generator must have [ffff00]at least one operational module at all times[-] to prevent a meltdown. I may be able to replace them if I can find some spare modules... or manufacture new ones somehow. I'll need be careful when replacing them though.
