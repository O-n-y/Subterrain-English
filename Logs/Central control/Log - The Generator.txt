I've found my way into the reactor for the colony.

This power plant is one of humanity's most remarkable achievements: it's an inertia drive.

Inertia drives run almost endlessly via a core inertia engine. While it doesn't generate quite as much energy as fusion based technology, what it produces is clean, reliable, and endless.

Without it, MPO would have never been founded in the first place. The guy that designed this thing must have been inspired; I still hardly understand how it works. What I can understand, though, is that it's been damaged somehow. I can't tell by looking at it directly, but the generator's status readout indicates that it's losing capacity at a constant rate. I don't think I'll be able to fix this!

It looks like the generator's [ffff00]reactor modules[-] are burning out due to the damage. The generator must have at least [ffff00]one operational module[-] installed to prevent a meltdown. I might be able to find some spare modules around here somewhere, but I should plan on taking a core down to [ffff00]Herbert Research[-]. Once there, I can see if the research machines can create a schematic that I can use to produce more in [ffff00]Nilson Engineering[-].

If power draw exceeds the generator's capacity, the generator's sure to fail. I should be okay for a while, but I need to figure out how to offset this. If I don't, it won't be long before there's only enough power for Central Control.
