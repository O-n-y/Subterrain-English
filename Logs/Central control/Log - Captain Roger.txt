[ccccff][i]Martin! MARTIN!! Keep this recording on you so you can remember what you need to do! You can do this!

I know you couldn't find much at the space center, but don't lose hope! We don't have [ffff00]space suits[-], so I need you to avoid all the areas where life support is down. The central cluster still seems to be okay, so I want you to take the train there.

Head over to the [ffff00]mine[-] and try to gather up some supplies. You wouldn't believe the stuff they have in storage over there, and you might be able to find some food in the break room if it hasn't been raided already. Grab whatever you can find, then head back here so we can get out before those... whatever those were get you.

Please, for the love of God, don't get distracted. Do NOT run off to the [ffff00]Plaza[-] for choco pies or anything else. I'm counting on you, dammit! Get what you can from the mine, then head back here. Got it?! No choco pies! That's an order!

...and don't forget that [ffff00]key card[-]! It's the only way to open the space center's security door and the only way back in. We need to try to keep more of those things out, and this is the only way! Don't lose it!

This is Captain Roger, signing off.[/i][-]
