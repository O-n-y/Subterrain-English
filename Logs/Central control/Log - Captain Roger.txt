[ccccff][i]Martin! It's too late to make it to shuttles 1 or 3.

Those are packed to the brim and have taken off already.

I'm trying to fix up this bird so that I can pilot her out of here.

Those turkeys thought [ffff00]Shuttle 2[-] was grounded for good, that it couldn't be fixed.

Awe rat shit! They just lacked vision.

As soon as you finish getting supplies from the [ffff00]mine[-], try to make it over here and we'll fly out together.

Please don't get distracted.  We don't need our usual snacks from the [ffff00]Plaza[-] or anything else.

Get what you need from the mine and then get over here fast.

And don't forget that [ffff00]key card[-] or you won't make it through the front door.


Captain Roger, signing off.
