[ccccff][i]Martin! MARTIN!! Don't bother heading to shuttles one or three. They've left already! Just [ffff00]shuttle 2[-] is left, but she's grounded. I'm trying as fast as I can to fix up this heaping hunk of shit, but hot damn, is it a mess! I'm going to be here a while, so I've got a job for you to take care of while I'm busy.

Head over to the [ffff00]mine[-] and try to gather up some supplies. You wouldn't believe the stuff they have in storage over there, and you might be able to find some food in the break room if it hasn't been raided. Grab whatever you can find, then head back here so we can get out before those... whatever those were get us.

Please, for the love of God, don't get distracted. Do NOT run off to the [ffff00]Plaza[-] for choco pies or anything else. I'm counting on you, dammit! Get what you can from the mine, then head back here. Got it?! No choco pies! That's an order!

...and don't forget that [ffff00]key card[-]! It's the only way to open the space center's security door and the only way back in. Don't lose it!

This is Captain Roger, signing off.[/i][-]
