Damn, am I lucky! On top of avoiding the "infected," I have also been fortunate enough to not die from [ffff00]suffocation[-] or [ffff00]hypothermia[-].

That may change quickly, if I'm not prepared.

The power console indicated that the [ffff00]oxygen filters[-] and [ffff00]thermal regulators[-] are offline for most of the colony, so I'll need to find some [ffff00]oxygen and thermal canisters[-] if I'm going to access those areas safely. Once I find some, I can charge them using [ffff00]recharging stations[-].

I should also try and fix the oxygen generators and thermal regulators whenever I can. Once I do, I'll be able to breathe or keep warm without the need for canisters.
