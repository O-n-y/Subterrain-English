Damn I am lucky!  Other than being alive, I have also been lucky enough to not die due to [ffff00]lack of oxygen[-] and [ffff00]hypothermia[-].

But that may change quickly if I don't prepare myself before I travel to the other locations in the colony.

The power console indicated that the [ffff00]oxygen generators and thermal regulators are offline[-] for most of the colony so I'll need to find some [ffff00]oxygen and thermal canisters[-] and charge them using the [ffff00]recharging stations[-].

I should also try and fix the oxygen generators and thermal regulators whenever I can.
