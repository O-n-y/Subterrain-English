Agent Heather Morgan, reporting in. 

There have been no suspicions so far, Sir. The mission was a success.

I tried to apply for a research intern position at the biosphere, but because my specialty didn't lie in research, they wouldn't take me. Another option became clear: administration. Starting as a secretary, I managed to infiltrate the administration of Spirit Plaza fairly quickly. I shot up the hierarchy; my superiors tended to be "accident prone" when I was around. It hadn't even been a year before I became District Manager of the Plaza.

As the district manager, I was placed in charge of everything that occurred in the plaza, including sanitation and safety in food storage. I took samples from the restaurant's pantry, cross-analyzing them with the sample from Earth. It was a match! Listeriosis was in Mars' food supply as well. I gathered evidence and found that the produce originated from the biosphere here at MPO. I lobbied the council shortly after.

The council heard my case, and agreed it was bad for tourism and profits. I nominated myself as head of the investigation, and with a little greasing of the wheels... I was put in charge. My first order of business was to inspect the biosphere's facilities. Curiously, many produce items weren't infected, but I ended up finding the source: Mars lettuce.

The head researcher, Dr. Tayama, fought me every step of the way. That bastard was probably hiding this from everyone, I just know it. I'm going to lobby the council for direct control of the biosphere after I present these Listeriosis samples, and then find out what Dr. Tayama knows any way I can. If this was a direct attack on Earth, I plan on secretly extraditing him so that he can be properly charged with bioterrorism.

I'm keeping the evidence in a safe house I set up in the [ffff00]Aries District[-] just in case I am caught.

I am preparing to dispose of this alias. I will update when I have an ETA.[/i][-]
