[i][ffffc0]Zeronica's Log:[-][ccccff]
Undercover Agent Heather Morgan reporting.
  
Nobody suspects my true identity or purpose on the colony.

I wasn't able to get access to anything as a line cook, so I took the initiative to replace my boss as the Lead Manager of the entire Plaza district.

I ran into some friction with Dr. Tayama in the biosphere, so I had to remove him.

I now have total control of the biosphere and the Plaza district.

And that is how I managed to track down the source of the E. Coli poisoning.

It was that lettuce they grow in the biosphere.

A few batches must have made it back to Earth because the sample I brought matches them perfectly.

I'm keeping the evidence in a safe house I set up at district [ffff00]Aries.[-]

Martian lettuce caused the deaths on Earth!  All in a day's work for a U.S. Health Inspector.[/i][-]


E. Coli?  Think I'll stay away from those lettuce wraps.
