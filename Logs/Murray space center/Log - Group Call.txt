[ccccff][i][ffffc0]Martin:[-] 
  Captain! Are you there, bro?! BRO?!

[ffffc0]Captain Roger:[-]
  Martin! I'm here, buddy! Did you 
  find a space suit?! It's a big
  white suit with a huge helmet!

[ccccff][i][ffffc0]Martin:[-] 
  I'm scared bro! More of those angry
  dudes are here!

[ffffc0]Captain Roger:[-]
  Focus, Martin! Did you find the suit?!

[ccccff][i][ffffc0]Martin:[-] 
  No... no suits. Just this chip thing, bro!
  
[ffffc0]Captain Roger:[-]
  Okay, hold on. Let me call Morris.
  
[ffffff]//Initiating group call: adding Morris//[-]

[ffffc0]Morris:[-]
  Uhhh... hello?
  
[ffffc0]Captain Roger:[-]
  Morris! Did you find any space suits
  when you were at the space center?
  
[ffffc0]Morris:[-]
  Uhhh... no.

[ffffc0]Captain Roger:[-]
  Shit!
  
[ccccff][i][ffffc0]Martin:[-] 
  You swore, bro! What's wrong?
  
[ffffc0]Captain Roger:[-]
  [ffff00]Life support systems[-] are down
  in many districts for some reason. I was
  hoping that the IEVA suits would help
  you guys find supplies [ffff00]without ever
  running low on oxygen or freezing to
  death[-]. We need to find three before we
  can get out of here, anyway. Bring that 
  chip here, Martin.
  
[ccccff][i][ffffc0]Martin:[-] 
  I'm already next to you, bro! See me waving
  from the control room?
  
[ffffc0]Captain Roger:[-]
  ... I'll just do it later. Martin, scrounge
  up whatever you can around the space center.
  Morris, you come back to shuttle two. I have
  a job for you.
  
[ffffc0]Morris:[-]
  Uhhh... okay.

[ccccff][i][ffffc0]Martin:[-] 
  Got it, bro!
