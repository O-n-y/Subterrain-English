Murray Space Center.

It's odd being here again after all that's happened. When I first got here, it was little more than a glorified landing pad. It looks totally different now. I guess we've both gone through some changes.

If I'm lucky, there might still be a [ffff00]shuttle[-] parked in one of the hangars.

The shuttles aren't long distance transports. It's more of a ferry service to Mars Orbital Station, where all the long distance crafts can dock. A shuttle won't get me back to Earth, but I'd rather take my chances with Mars Orbital Station then spend any longer than I have to at MPO.
