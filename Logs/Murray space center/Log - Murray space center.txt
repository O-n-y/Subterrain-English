Murray Space Center.

Fancy seeing you again.

I remember seeing this place when I first got here.

It was a lot smaller back then and I was still full of enthusiasm.

But that was before they opened up all of that space tourism crap and expanded the mining operation...

Now it supports three shuttles... if I'm very lucky there might still be a shuttle in one of the hangers.
