[ccccff][i]Martin...  

Dammit, I held out as long as I could.

Well, that's the bad news.  The worse news is that there's no chance for you to get out of here.

Not unless you can manufacture [ffff00]five fuel cells[-] and repair that [ffff00]nav module.[-]

I sent that idiot Morris to the [ffff00]biosphere[-] with the [ffff00]data chip[-] to make some fuel cells.

That was days ago, I think it's safe to say he's a goner by now, Lord save that boy...  The nav module will take some doing to fix up.

It's err... well it's easy you just have to research it and make another...

But I don't think you'll manage.  No offense, you just aren't survivor material... Just enjoy what time you have left.  Eat some snack cakes or something.
