Man, what a mess. The pod was trashed from the landing, and I'm in the middle of nowhere. 

I can see MPO, but I'm not really sure which side I'm looking at. It's only a few kilometers away, but how the hell am I going to get back inside? I don't ever recall ever seeing an airlock in most districts, but there's gotta be some other way in. Maybe an access hatch, or some sort of maintenance area?

...Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but it looks like there's some kind of [ffff00]structure[-] between me and MPO. It's small, though, much smaller than any of MPO's domes. It could be some sort of service elevator. I'm not sure why there'd be one this far out, but I don't really have any other options. Worst case scenario, there might be a terminal I can access.
