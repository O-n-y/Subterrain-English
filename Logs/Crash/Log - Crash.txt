...seems like I was out for a bit... 

The damn pod still feels like it's spinning. I guess that's a good sign that I haven't died yet. I still remember that man's face just before he shot me down. They must have been waiting up there, but why? And why haven't they sent help? 

I guess I must have landed. All the monitors are on the floor. I guess I took a tumble on the way back down. I'm a little beat up, but the seat's harness must have kept me from slamming around the pod. According to the diagnostic: life support's been knocked offline entirely. I guess it's a good thing I followed safety protocols. Navcom's displaying an error. It looks like the pod was trying to get as close to MPO as possible, but it went off course a little at some point due to a mechanical failure.

Ow... man, I could use an aspirin.
