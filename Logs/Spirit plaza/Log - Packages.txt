I found stacks and stacks of packages all filled with... Mars crystals? They don't look quite right, though, as if they are made of colored glass or something. The real ones have a sort of fogginess to them.

All these packages are addressed to the same person in the [ffff00]Pisces District[-]: 

Zeronica Jones.
