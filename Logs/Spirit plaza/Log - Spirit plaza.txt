I don't know much about this place...

But, what started out as a simple Canteen to serve meals to the Martian workforce, was expanded upon when Carson Hotel started delivering tourists.

It now features a Restaurant, Cafe, and Souvenir Shop.

The most popular souvenir being the iridescent crystals that grow in certain Martian caves.

New Age cults on Earth revere the crystals, believing them to have magic healing properties.

For the past few months, the Plaza has been overseen by a energetic young woman named Zeronica Jones.

Starting out as a line-cook in the restaurant, she quickly rose through the ranks to become manager of the entire Plaza.

Due to problems in the food supply originating at the biosphere, Zeronica took it upon herself to capture the biosphere by force and bring it under her jurisdiction.

The young line cook from Chattanooga has certainly raised some eyebrows.

Managers from other districts were taking notice. But that was long time ago.
