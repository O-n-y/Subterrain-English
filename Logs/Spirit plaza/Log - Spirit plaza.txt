I don't really know much about Spirit Plaza. I've only been here a few times when Rascowicz insisted on hanging out at the bar around here.

I'm not really sure if it was always this way, but it's something of a mini mall. It features a restaurant, a cafe, and a souvenir shop. It was a popular location for tourists. Of all the Mars souvenirs, cave crystals were something so popular that even the native "Martians" wore them.

The plaza's empty now, aside from a quiet shambling echoing around the corner. Each of the stores has a big gold plaque near the door: 

"Inspected and Approved by Zeronica Jones, District Manager of Spirit Plaza"

I don't recall her name all over the place when I was here before, nor do I remember any "inspected" or "approved" signage before.
