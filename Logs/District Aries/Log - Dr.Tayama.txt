There's a body here crumpled up on the floor. It looks like Dr. Tayama, the lead researcher at the biosphere. He's been dead for a while.

There are various supplies scattered across the room.

Damn... I guess this was what Zeronica meant by "enhanced interrogation tactics" in that bulletin.

I also found a log. It's covered in blood.

[ccccff]Agent Heather Morgan, reporting in for the last time.

Heather Morgan is dead to me. She was a weak, ineffectual cog in the bureaucratic machine of Earth. Maybe it's the money talking, or the power, or the thrill of killing a man with my bare hands. I don't know...

What I do know is that I have no reason to go back to Earth.

Mr. Murray found out about Dr. Tayama's death. I thought he'd kill me or make an example of me; toss me in the prison along with all his other trash. Instead, he said I had proved myself. He congratulated me.

Mr. Murray shared his vision with me. On Earth, if we aren't slaves, we're just people. Simple people. Even he was. On Mars, we can be Gods in a kingdom we've carved out for ourselves. [/i][-]

...I guess Murray wasn't as benevolent as he appeared to be.
