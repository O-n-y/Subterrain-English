[ccccff][i]Hey, man, you passed out after the "party". Learn to hold your liquor!

Anyway, I can't believe we finally got that smug son of a bitch, dude! Can you believe all the shit he was carrying on him? He was like a pinata! Hah, and after all that crap about "gracing us with his presence", the only thing he ended up gracing is the floor!

I figure since this party was mostly our idea, you and I can split the chips he had. I'll keep the other data chip at my place in [ffff00]Leo[-] for safe keeping. I suggest you hide your chip, too! Don't let anyone else take it! It's probably worth a lot!

After this blows over, we can figure out how to sell them! Take it easy until then, dude![/i][-]
