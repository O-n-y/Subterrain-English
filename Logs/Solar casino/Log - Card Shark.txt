[ccccff][i]Hey, Johnny...

I got caught workin' tables. I guess I couldn't control myself. They didn't believe it was "luck." They beat me pretty bad - I'm going to have to see a doc, but after I'm done, I got a better gig for us...

Just after his goons worked me over, Bigelow himself had me brought to his [ffff00]office[-] so he could lord over me or some shit. That idiot didn't think ahead, though! I got a glimpse into what's gotta be a [ffff00]stash room[-] in his office. There's chips all over that room, man! I imagine there's even better prizes in the boxes if we can bust in.

We gotta move quick, man! It's not going to take long before the news about me being banned gets around the staff! Come meet me at the clinic and we'll get started![/i][-]
