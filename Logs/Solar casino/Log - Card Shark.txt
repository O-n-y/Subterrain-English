[ccccff][i]Look, I don't have much time.  I managed lift that goon's phone so I could send you this message.

You gotta come spring me, Johnny!!!  I was workin' the tables here, doing everything how you showed me.

Somehow Biggelow's guys caught on and they nabbed me and then they beat me up pretty bad.  Agh...  I think I'm gonna need to see a chiropractor...

I just got too greedy.  Counting the cards, the thrill of winning...  I just couldn't stop winning!

But listen!  If you get me out of this cell I can make us both rich!

The man himself, Biggelow, had me brought to his [ffff00]office[-] to tell me to stay away from his Casino once and for all.

I saw where he keeps the [ffff00]Data Chip![-]  The one for upgrading the mine facility!

Imagine if we could get that thing.

You could get plastic surgery for your wife, and I'd have enough to go back to barber school![/i][-]
