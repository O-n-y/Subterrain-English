[ccccff][i]Hey Boss.  What should we do with this data chip?  

Want us to bring it to the High-Rollers private poker match in the residential district at [ffff00]Leo[-]? 
Also, we took care of that trouble maker from the other night, if you know what I mean...  
Let's just say he did an involuntary total-recall out of the airlock hehehehe.


[ffffc0]Re:[-] Jaron, bring the [ffff00]Data Chip[-] to the match.  Also, never talk about criminal conspiracies on email, you idiotic Gorilla.
