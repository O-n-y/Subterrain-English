The Solar Casino, owned by a "Mr. Bigelow." I remember seeing ads for it on Earth.

The casino was like any other: saps come in with cash and walk out with nothing. Due to lax laws on Mars, the casino was set up to convert property deeds into chips and allowed potential fortune seekers to borrow against their future earnings.

For the tourists, it was a charming way to relax after ascending Olympus-Mons, but for the locals, it was a form of perpetual servitude. Bigelow charged for everything, even his employees' room and board needs weren't comped.

"Mr. Bigelow" didn't have a first name. His face, adorned with big aviator sunglasses, was plastered all over the place. I'd recognize that face and fake tan anywhere, though, sunglasses or otherwise. "Mr. Bigelow" was Rudolph Drump, an exiled businessman from Earth that was being hunted for a few years before I packed up for Mars.

The guy was an old money kid who couldn't stay out of the spotlight. He got a small loan of a few billion dollars from his family and opened a bunch of oil businesses, everything from syphoning to refinement, despite the mass shift to alternative energy sources decades prior. The news was always filled with his insensitive comments about trending issues.

Before long, there was a huge leak by the activist group "Pseudonymous," a group that had infiltrated his private computer network.

Petabytes and petabytes of information flooded the public. Extortion, fraud, bribery; he'd done it all and then some. The Federal Agents of Earth shut down his refineries and oil rigs and attempted to freeze his assets, but it was much too late. Drump was nowhere to be found. Guess I found him... I wonder if there's still a reward?
