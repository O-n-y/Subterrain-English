Biggelow's Solar casino.

Biggelow was always a big fish.

Back on earth he'd made a fortune in offshore oil extraction.  When the federal authorities began raiding his offices and refineries on earth, he liquidated his assets and took them off-world.  

On Mars he oversaw the extraction of minerals from the Mars mining facilities.  He used the wealth generated there to create the Casino.

At the casino, you could roll the dice and make your dreams come true. If they didn't come true, no worries. Mars is a small place with an efficient banking system. 

Biggelow's tight connections to the bankers made it possible to convert property deeds and future income into poker chips at the click of a button.

In this way Biggelow managed to take advantage of bored miners and colonists, and keep them in a state of perpetual servitude.  

For the tourists it was a charming way to relax after ascending Olympus-Mons.
