[ccccff][i]So here's the bottom line.  I've been case'n the joint for days now.

The guards always bring the day's take to the vault two floors down.

Last month 11 guys got whacked tryin' an elaborate plan to rob the vault.  They even had this Chinese contortionist on the job.  Guy could squeeze through anything.  Didn't make a difference.  Security plugged 'em full of holes.

But get this: that vault's just a ringer!  A decoy!  Gorgeous Gabe put his handsome mug to work and got the goods from this hot little number in accounting.

See they put the real earnings in a secret vault on the third floor.  The vault door is on the floor, underneath a chair in the janitor's closet.

All the earnings come in from pneumatic tubes so there's no delivery to watch.  

I tell yah, this is gonna be the big score.  You mugs is lucky I'm letting you in on this one.[/i][-]
