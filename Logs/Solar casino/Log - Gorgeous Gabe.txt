[ccccff][i]So, here's the bottom line: I've been casin' the joint for days now.

The guards always bring the day's earnings to the same vault, two floors down.

Last month, eleven guys got greased tryin' an elaborate plan to rob the vault. They even had this Chinese contortionist on the job. The guy was famous; he could squeeze through anything. Too bad he couldn't squeeze between lasers, though. Security plugged 'em full of holes.

But get this: that vault's just a ringer! An elaborate decoy to attract all the heat! Gorgeous Gabe put his handsome mug to work and got the goods from this hot little number in accounting.

See, they put the real earnings in a secret vault on the third floor.  The vault door is on the floor underneath a chair in the janitor's closet.

All the earnings come in from pneumatic tubes, so there's no delivery to watch.  

I tell yah, this is gonna be the big score. You mugs is lucky I'm letting you in on this one.[/i][-]
