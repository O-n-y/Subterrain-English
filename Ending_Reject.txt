I took off my glasses and covered my eyes. For the first time, in a very long time, I let out a sigh. There was no relief, though.

As the light left her gaze, I realized I was the last person on MPO. The only remaining shuttle had been ripped in half. Mars Orbital Station would most likely contact Earth for support.

What Earth’s government would do after was anyone’s guess. They could capture me, kill me, or worse. MPO had become my prison once more, this time in solitary confinement.

I didn’t have any options. I realized something, though: I never did once I set foot on Mars.

I wish I never left Earth. I wish I stayed by her side to the very end. I was never going to be able to save her.

I put my glasses back on, and I some of her ashes in my hands.

She would need a proper place to rest. Anywhere but here.
